# Connect4-Python
A simple Connect 4 game made in Python. Can be played with AI or with another player.

The game was made only using python code and doesn't have a GUI.

By the start of the game you are asked to specify the name of the two players. If you
specify the name of the second player as "AI" you will play with the computer.

My implementation of the AI isn't very intelligent, however, it will try to block you whenever there is a chance.
